Instead of continuing with <span class=\"float-notes\">climbing<span>Usually split to first build strength and then to build power.</span></span> specific training, I spent a few months adjusting to that new strength; aka, reaping the benefits. After a decade of being warned against <span class=\"float-notes\">hangboarding<span>On the common fear of hangboarding, in Beastmaking, Ned Feehally writes, \"[fingerboard training] is the safest way of training finger strength as it is very controlled, you can apply the load slowly and let go at any time\".</span></span> and (worse) <span class=\"float-notes\">campus boarding<span>On the ubiquity of campus boarding, Ned writes, \"modern climbing walls have developed so far and become so good that the campus board seems massively dated;\" instead, he suggests campusing routes and training on a system board.</span></span>&mdash;\"you'll injure yourself!\"&mdash;why not just continue with the same training? It works! \n\nThe first two hints against this plan come from the [9c \"ultimate\" climbing test](https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/how-close-are-you-to-climbing-5-15d/) and the [Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0](https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/):\n\n  * my \"9c score\" is <span class=\"float-notes\">14<span>Which corresponds to a sport climbing grade of 7b ~ 5.12b but I don't sport climb...MEC translates that to ~V5.</span></span>, 6 coming from core alone\n  * and my \"upper body strength is *quite high* compared to [my] finger strength\" when it is already <span class=\"float-notes\">*lower*<span>Comparing max weighted 5 pull-ups with 10s 19mm half crimp maxhangs.</span></span> than my finger strength\n\nLooks like my core and pulling training have already outpaced my finger training. \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\nIf you see a bar chart, I'm counting climbers per value (eg. per V grade, per number of years, or per number of hours), or showing some amount per category.\n\nIf you see a scatter plot, each circle is one climber from the dataset with coordinates of eg. height versus V grade. The superposed line shows the average (height) over climbers (at each V grade) or the trend line when the data is too noisy. \n\nPink is for female climbers; blue for male; purple is for both pooled when the data is sparse.\n\nMost of the plots are across tabs: select each tab to view them all.\n\nAlso: <span class=\"float-notes\">hover over me<span>Many technical comments, asides, and personal anecdotes can be found associated with the double-dash underlined text.

He trains to bench press more and more, 50kg then 150kg&mdash;it's improving his throws!&mdash;200kg, 300kg&mdash;and yet he can throw no further. He got stronger, yes, but what he needed was more power. \n\nBut what is the ideal strength profile of a boulderer? How much finger strength? How much pulling strength? How much power? More is surely better but what is a good balance progressing from V-lo through V-mid to V-hi? What about push-ups, legs and endurance?  Surely it depends on my specific goals and likely on my height, arm span, and hand size also, but general estimates would still help guide my training. \n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I'll analyse and model a [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1J6d45EqIlIsIqNdi2X-Zl-EGFxf9d9T3R_W55xrpEAs/edit) collected from a survey on Reddit, including many <span class=\"float-notes\">strength<span>Half-crimp and open hand 10s max hangs on 18mm edge; 5-rep pull-up max weight; max hanging L-sit time; # pull-ups / push-ups.</span></span> metrics, <span class=\"float-notes\">training<span>Training specifics included hangboard protocols (eg. repeaters, max hangs, min edges, one-armed protocols, etc.), grip types trained (eg. half crimp, open hand, etc.); endurance training protocols (4x4, threshold intervals, feet on campusing, etc.); non-specific training (upper body pulling and pushing, core, legs and antagonists); other activities (running, yoga, skiing, martial arts, etc); and the number of sessions and hours per week doing various kinds of training.</span></span> habits and basic climber <span class=\"float-notes\">attributes<span>Height, weight, arm span, years climbing, indoors vs outdoors, and various bouldering and climbing grades.</span></span>. We'll see how these climbers balance and progress their strengths through the grades; how they train at each stage; and see that height and BMI both have a <span class=\"float-notes\">sweet spot<span>Most aspects in a complex system have a 'sweet spot': any time there are competing factors at play, the optimum is somewhere in the middle when neither penalty is too extreme. Weight scales very loosely as a cube of height; muscles is quadratic in height. If this were the only factor at play, then, in bodyweight sports, shorter would be strictly better (think gymnastics): this would give a max strength scaling with weight with power 0.666, analysing world record athletes finds a power of 0.63 -- close! In climbing, reach is still important and increases with height linearly. Balancing the two opposing factors, we should find an optimal height and corresponding weight. BMI is weight over height *squared* so it too should increase for similarly strong athletes (in a bodyweight sport) with increasing height and it too will have an optimum by the same arguments.</span></span>, not too low, not too high. \n\n*What about <span class=\"float-notes\">mobility<span>Mobility is the stability and strength through your full range of motion.</span></span>? Although certainly quantifiable, no mobility assessments are in the dataset I'll be using, so my analysis will not consider it, but more on this later.*\n\n\n\n## Meet the Climbers\n\nSpecial guests include: \nMegan, better known as @fearlesstofu in social media, and her strong climbing friend, Nelson [@aloeveraelephant](https://www.instagram.com/aloeveraelephant/).

Grading gets more complicated when we consider <a href=\"https://boulderingboss.com/indoor-vs-outdoor-bouldering-is-there-a-difference-in-v-grades/\">indoor vs outdoor</a> (or moonboard vs kilter board for that matter).  \n\nMax ever V grade is problematic: the climber may have sent it years ago and their current strength and habits aren't what they once were. The spread is as wide as 4 V grades for a climber of 15 years and, generally, <span class=\"float-notes\">wider<span>Although a few climbers claimed the opposite: that their recent max is higher than their max ever. Presumably, they read the survey questions wrong and I reversed their grades.</span></span> at higher V grades. \n\nThe doable grade is highly subjective.  Should we consider all styles? Or just the style we love and climb well. What about the reachy climbs if you’re short, or the overly compressed climbs if you’re tall? Just how peaky is your <a href=\"https://hiveclimbing.com/blog/climbing-pyramid/\">climbing pyramid</a>? Do you always get beta from others before trying?

The numbers are similar for men and women and <span class=\"float-notes\">agree<span>Though Lattice Training uses 7s/20mm max hangs vs 10s/18mm max hangs gathered by this survey.</span></span> fairly well with the climbers from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zNGplJMyG/\" target=\"__blank\">Lattice Training</a>: each V grade requires adding another 8% of body weight to max hangs; to climb 9c would require ~<span class=\"float-notes\">1.1<span>That's a hang with 110% of bodyweight added, or 210% total weight.</span></span>. Silence, the first 9c, was put up by Adam Ondra with max hangs of 112%; Bibliographie, briefly the second 9c, was first climbed by Alex Megos whose max hangs are an astonishing 132%. \n\nWhile finger strength didn’t show a big gender difference, the normalized weight added to 5 pull-ups is <span class=\"float-notes\">10-20% more<span>Either the women make do with less pulling strength or they prefer problems that don’t require it.</span></span> for male climbers at any given grade. Pulling strength increases with grade up to around <span class=\"float-notes\">0.8<span>80% of bodyweight, in agreement with the pulling to finger strength ratio recommended by the Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0 (0.75) and the Lattice Training finger strength estimate of 1.1 to climb 9c, where 0.8 ~ 0.75*1.1.</span></span> at the highest grades. \nFor any given grade, the male climbers seem to do twice as many pull-ups or push-ups as the women. Despite many over-achievers, more modest goals of 20-25 pull-ups and 30-40 push-ups seem sufficient for climbing. \nLess than 25% submitted their L-sit time and many <span class=\"float-notes\">suspiciously<span>Were they just guessing or did they get bored and give up?</span></span> answered an even 30s and 60s and 12 with times exceeding the world record.\n\nHere are the same metrics visually; like before, click through the tabs to see them all.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Finger Strength\n![Both Megan and Nelson seem to have more finger strength than their recent grade merits, but both fall perfectly on the trendline using their max ever V grades (8, 11).](maxfinger.png){width=80%}\n\n## 5-rep Weighted Pullups\n![For 5-rep pull-up strength, the women trend a steady 0.2 (or 20% of bodyweight) below the men.

And how do they compare as we get stronger? How do half crimp and open hand compare for finger strength?\n\nWhen finger and pulling strength are still low, pulling strength exceeds finger strength in both women and men. As they increase, women quickly develop <span class=\"float-notes\">far more<span>Megan has more than 6x finger strength than pulling strength!</span></span> stronger fingers; the men develop equal finger strength only when both are ~50% body weight. In the strongest climbers, finger strength settles at roughly double pulling strength.\n\nThe difference between <span class=\"float-notes\">half crimp<span>Not to be confused with full crimp that engages the thumb.</span></span> and  <span class=\"float-notes\">open hand<span>Not to be confused with 3 finger drag that drops the pinky.</span></span> max hangs may average out to zero but less than a third of <span class=\"float-notes\">those<span>35% of climbers gave half crimp max hangs, 28% gave open hand max hangs while 25% gave both: which tips the balance another 10% in favour of half crimps.

In Beastmaking, Ned suggests that hand anatomy plays a role in which grip a climber favours.

Compare that to hrs on the campus board per week that varies from 0 to 5 where half an hour can make a difference.</span></span> estimates how much the model relies on it for predictions; feature *influence* is the average gains for a standard small shift in that feature. \n\nBy far the most important feature is how many years a climber has been climbing and, next in importance, is the number of hours climbing per week. After all: \n\n>   Climbing is the best training for climbing\n\nThe top strength metrics by any measure are the number of pull-ups, half crimp strength, and the number of hours campus board training per week. Campus board training is synonymous with training for <span class=\"float-notes\">power<span>Power is a measure of the rate of force applied; think of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe4LyDihDQ\" title=\"What is Contact Strength? (A Climbing Nerd’s Investigation) Part 1/3 from Hooper's Beta\">contact strength</a> and how much harder it is to catch a bad hold in a lunge than to grab it statically, or think of the fast pulling strength to initiate that lunge.</span></span> so we can say:\n\n>   Finger and pulling strength and power are the best predictors of climbing grade\n\nConsistently important and somewhat influential, we find BMI. For climbers with BMI < 20 (>25), raising (lowering) BMI always increases the expected grade; in between, predictions go up or down depending on the individual. The largest prediction changes were for climbers that didn't provide many strength metrics; for the three of us that did, BMI influence was <span class=\"float-notes\">tiny<span>I saw the largest gains: by lowering my BMI by 0.5 (aka, losing 3lbs), my predicted grade increases by 0.17.</span></span>. \n\nBoth feature assessments entirely ignore the <span class=\"float-notes\">correlation<span>And among all the other features too. Features that are strongly correlated: number of pull-ups and pull-up strength (0.50), number of pull-ups and number of push-ups (0.44), years climbing and half crimp strength (0.34), BMI and number of push-ups (0.24), etc.</span></span> of BMI to the strength metrics: being <span class=\"float-notes\">lighter<span>Furthermore, the denominator in the normalized metrics further amplifies any weight loss.</span></span> makes all body-weight exercises easier; while having more muscle more than compensates for the added weight. There's a limit in both lines of thinking: we should only lose excess fat and muscle and keep a safe weight for optimal recovery; we should only gain muscle beneficial to climbing and carefully balance muscle strength. To quote Tomoa from <a href=\"https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/climbing/beastmaking/\">Beastmaking</a>:\n\n>   After trying to reinforce a specific skill or train a body part, it is found that it made the total balance of the body corrupted.  &mdash;Tomoa Narasaki\n\nTo estimate the maximum expected gains of each climber, we can add up all the positive influences. These gains diminish with grade; but, luckily (if true), Megan, Nelson and I have high estimated gains for our V grade.  \n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Feature Influence\n\n![The feature influence considers the change in expected grade for a shift in a given feature.

Are you more like Megan with >6x stronger fingers than pulling strength? Or like the handful of climbers that can add nearly their full bodyweight to 5 pullups and yet only climb V4? Assess yourself to see your strength profile: how balanced is it and how does it compare to the grades you're climbing? As you progress, how does your climbing improve with increased strength? \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n  <h3>Ongoing data to collect</h3>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>indoor, system board and outdoor grades: new milestones and <span class=\"float-notes\">sends/attempts<span>Attempts are good to track, especially for problems eventually climbed, but not all attempts are equal.

That means our models are merely descriptive and cannot make \"causal\" conclusions. Still, we can expect that, if not on an individual level, then at least in aggregate, the (mean) V6 climber progresses into a V9 climber, and might progress into a V12 climber, so that the model is at least a progressive description. </p>\n\n<p>A model is only as good as the dataset it learns from: while ours clearly found stronger climbers climbed harder grades, it found that all forms of endurance, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XONhxQ-Gbk\" title=\"Super easy leg training to climb better in the cave AND on slab - Hooper's Beta Ep. 8\">leg</a>, core, and mobility training  <em>lowered</em> expected grade.

It works! \n\nThe first two hints against this plan come from the [9c \"ultimate\" climbing test](https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/how-close-are-you-to-climbing-5-15d/) and the [Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0](https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/):\n\n  * my \"9c score\" is <span class=\"float-notes\">14<span>Which corresponds to a sport climbing grade of 7b ~ 5.12b but I don't sport climb...MEC translates that to ~V5.</span></span>, 6 coming from core alone\n  * and my \"upper body strength is *quite high* compared to [my] finger strength\" when it is already <span class=\"float-notes\">*lower*<span>Comparing max weighted 5 pull-ups with 10s 19mm half crimp maxhangs.</span></span> than my finger strength\n\nLooks like my core and pulling training have already outpaced my finger training. \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n### Reading plots\n\nIf you see a bar chart, I'm counting climbers per value (eg. per V grade, per number of years, or per number of hours), or showing some amount per category.\n\nIf you see a scatter plot, each circle is one climber from the dataset with coordinates of eg. height versus V grade.

He trains to bench press more and more, 50kg then 150kg&mdash;it's improving his throws!&mdash;200kg, 300kg&mdash;and yet he can throw no further. He got stronger, yes, but what he needed was more power. \n\nBut what is the ideal strength profile of a boulderer? How much finger strength? How much pulling strength? How much power? More is surely better but what is a good balance progressing from V-lo through V-mid to V-hi? What about push-ups, legs and endurance?  Surely it depends on my specific goals and likely on my height, arm span, and hand size also, but general estimates would still help guide my training. \n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I'll analyse and model a [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1J6d45EqIlIsIqNdi2X-Zl-EGFxf9d9T3R_W55xrpEAs/edit) collected from a survey on Reddit, including many <span class=\"float-notes\">strength<span>Half-crimp and open hand 10s max hangs on 18mm edge; 5-rep pull-up max weight; max hanging L-sit time; # pull-ups / push-ups.</span></span> metrics, <span class=\"float-notes\">training<span>Training specifics included hangboard protocols (eg. repeaters, max hangs, min edges, one-armed protocols, etc.), grip types trained (eg. half crimp, open hand, etc.); endurance training protocols (4x4, threshold intervals, feet on campusing, etc.); non-specific training (upper body pulling and pushing, core, legs and antagonists); other activities (running, yoga, skiing, martial arts, etc); and the number of sessions and hours per week doing various kinds of training.</span></span> habits and basic climber <span class=\"float-notes\">attributes<span>Height, weight, arm span, years climbing, indoors vs outdoors, and various bouldering and climbing grades.</span></span>. We'll see how these climbers balance and progress their strengths through the grades; how they train at each stage; and see that height and BMI both have a <span class=\"float-notes\">sweet spot<span>Most aspects in a complex system have a 'sweet spot': any time there are competing factors at play, the optimum is somewhere in the middle when neither penalty is too extreme. Weight scales very loosely as a cube of height; muscles is quadratic in height. If this were the only factor at play, then, in bodyweight sports, shorter would be strictly better (think gymnastics): this would give a max strength scaling with weight with power 0.666, analysing world record athletes finds a power of 0.63 -- close! In climbing, reach is still important and increases with height linearly. Balancing the two opposing factors, we should find an optimal height and corresponding weight.

The numbers are similar for men and women and <span class=\"float-notes\">agree<span>Though Lattice Training uses 7s/20mm max hangs vs 10s/18mm max hangs gathered by this survey.</span></span> fairly well with the climbers from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zNGplJMyG/\" target=\"__blank\">Lattice Training</a>: each V grade requires adding another 8% of body weight to max hangs; to climb 9c would require ~<span class=\"float-notes\">1.1<span>That's a hang with 110% of bodyweight added, or 210% total weight.</span></span>. Silence, the first 9c, was put up by Adam Ondra with max hangs of 112%; Bibliographie, briefly the second 9c, was first climbed by Alex Megos whose max hangs are an astonishing 132%. \n\nWhile finger strength didn’t show a big gender difference, the normalized weight added to 5 pull-ups is <span class=\"float-notes\">10-20% more<span>Either the women make do with less pulling strength or they prefer problems that don’t require it.</span></span> for male climbers at any given grade. Pulling strength increases with grade up to around <span class=\"float-notes\">0.8<span>80% of bodyweight, in agreement with the pulling to finger strength ratio recommended by the Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0 (0.75) and the Lattice Training finger strength estimate of 1.1 to climb 9c, where 0.8 ~ 0.75*1.1.</span></span> at the highest grades. \nFor any given grade, the male climbers seem to do twice as many pull-ups or push-ups as the women. Despite many over-achievers, more modest goals of 20-25 pull-ups and 30-40 push-ups seem sufficient for climbing. \nLess than 25% submitted their L-sit time and many <span class=\"float-notes\">suspiciously<span>Were they just guessing or did they get bored and give up?</span></span> answered an even 30s and 60s and 12 with times exceeding the world record.\n\nHere are the same metrics visually; like before, click through the tabs to see them all.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Finger Strength\n![Both Megan and Nelson seem to have more finger strength than their recent grade merits, but both fall perfectly on the trendline using their max ever V grades (8, 11).](maxfinger.png){width=80%}\n\n## 5-rep Weighted Pullups\n![For 5-rep pull-up strength, the women trend a steady 0.2 (or 20% of bodyweight) below the men.

And how do they compare as we get stronger? How do half crimp and open hand compare for finger strength?\n\nWhen finger and pulling strength are still low, pulling strength exceeds finger strength in both women and men. As they increase, women quickly develop <span class=\"float-notes\">far more<span>Megan has more than 6x finger strength than pulling strength!</span></span> stronger fingers; the men develop equal finger strength only when both are ~50% body weight. In the strongest climbers, finger strength settles at roughly double pulling strength.\n\nThe difference between <span class=\"float-notes\">half crimp<span>Not to be confused with full crimp that engages the thumb.</span></span> and  <span class=\"float-notes\">open hand<span>Not to be confused with 3 finger drag that drops the pinky.</span></span> max hangs may average out to zero but less than a third of <span class=\"float-notes\">those<span>35% of climbers gave half crimp max hangs, 28% gave open hand max hangs while 25% gave both: which tips the balance another 10% in favour of half crimps.

The model can better utilize a feature if more climbers provide it (percentage that did in brackets): \n\n<ul>\n  <li>open hand strength, 0.64 (28%)</li>\n  <li>half crimp strength, 0.59 (35%)</li>\n  <li># pull-ups, 0.49 (78%)</li>\n  <li>year, 0.43 (all)</li>\n  <li>hrs climbing per week, 0.32 (all)</li>\n  <li># hangboard/campus board sessions per week, 0.34/0.3 (all, 56%/26% do)</li>\n  <li>L-sit time, 0.31 (31%)</li>\n  <li>5-rep pull-up strength, 0.29 (46%)</li>\n  <li>hrs training per week, 0.26 (all, 46% train endurance, 79% train strength)</li>\n  <li># push-ups, 0.13 (61%)</li>\n  <li>BMI, -0.13 (all) </li>\n</ul>\n:::\n\nThe <span class=\"float-notes\">feature *importance*<span>Calculated by shuffling the values of that feature among all climbers and seeing how much worse the predictions are on average. The range each feature can take varies widely, and shuffling can give an entirely unreasonable shift in a given climber. Years vary from 0 to 15 and BMI from 15 to 30, and yet most of us can't wait a year to improve and fret over BMI increments of a few pounds. Compare that to hrs on the campus board per week that varies from 0 to 5 where half an hour can make a difference.</span></span> estimates how much the model relies on it for predictions; feature *influence* is the average gains for a standard small shift in that feature. \n\nBy far the most important feature is how many years a climber has been climbing and, next in importance, is the number of hours climbing per week. After all: \n\n>   Climbing is the best training for climbing\n\nThe top strength metrics by any measure are the number of pull-ups, half crimp strength, and the number of hours campus board training per week. Campus board training is synonymous with training for <span class=\"float-notes\">power<span>Power is a measure of the rate of force applied; think of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe4LyDihDQ\" title=\"What is Contact Strength? (A Climbing Nerd’s Investigation) Part 1/3 from Hooper's Beta\">contact strength</a> and how much harder it is to catch a bad hold in a lunge than to grab it statically, or think of the fast pulling strength to initiate that lunge.</span></span> so we can say:\n\n>   Finger and pulling strength and power are the best predictors of climbing grade\n\nConsistently important and somewhat influential, we find BMI. For climbers with BMI < 20 (>25), raising (lowering) BMI always increases the expected grade; in between, predictions go up or down depending on the individual. The largest prediction changes were for climbers that didn't provide many strength metrics; for the three of us that did, BMI influence was <span class=\"float-notes\">tiny<span>I saw the largest gains: by lowering my BMI by 0.5 (aka, losing 3lbs), my predicted grade increases by 0.17.</span></span>. \n\nBoth feature assessments entirely ignore the <span class=\"float-notes\">correlation<span>And among all the other features too. Features that are strongly correlated: number of pull-ups and pull-up strength (0.50), number of pull-ups and number of push-ups (0.44), years climbing and half crimp strength (0.34), BMI and number of push-ups (0.24), etc.</span></span> of BMI to the strength metrics: being <span class=\"float-notes\">lighter<span>Furthermore, the denominator in the normalized metrics further amplifies any weight loss.</span></span> makes all body-weight exercises easier; while having more muscle more than compensates for the added weight. There's a limit in both lines of thinking: we should only lose excess fat and muscle and keep a safe weight for optimal recovery; we should only gain muscle beneficial to climbing and carefully balance muscle strength.

For instance, 'core' is more than the muscles of your torso; it's the entire chain of muscles that lets you hold tension from hands to feet. Assessing with hanging L-sits doesn't cover the entire chain; the front lever comes closer, but neither covers the full variety of positions you'll hopefully get into bouldering.</span></span> to them. Assess once per training cycle to influence how you train in the next one; twice a year to monitor your progress if you're training by climbing. \n\n>  If you are still getting stronger and better by just climbing, then just climb! \n\nFrom one assessment to the next, look for trends in your response to different training stimuli. When you start to plateau with a given exercise, try a more advanced progression, if any, or just switch things up (eg. max hangs to repeaters). Monitor your load capacity and <span class=\"float-notes\">increase<span>If training gets you fitter and hence capable of more training (hurray!) or you're sleeping and eating better, and practicing active recovery.</span></span>/<span class=\"float-notes\">decrease<span>Because other stressors in life come up, or you have more opportunity to go climbing!

It's safer to aim low and recover well for each session than to aim high and risk injury and overtraining.\n\n<div class='nolist'>\n\n<p>**Max hangs** in half crimp, open hand, on a sloper, pinching, etc.:\n7-10s on a 20mm edge. One arm or two depends on how much weight you need to add; at some point, it makes more sense to take a little weight off and assess one-armed, with the added benefit of checking for left/right asymmetries. </p>\n\n<p>**Mobility**:\n<span class=\"float-notes\">hamstrings<span>Forward bend though it isolates the hamstrings better on the floor and, with a strap, pull your leg straight and measure the angle it makes with the floor. 60-70° is tight; 90° is ok; 105° is awesome.</span></span>; <span class=\"float-notes\">ankles<span>How far past your toes can your knee reach; aim for at least 5\", higher is better.</span></span>; <span class=\"float-notes\">hip turnout<span>How close to the wall can your body get with knees frogged, thighs parallel to the floor; hip bones should be at most 10\" from the wall, closer is better.</span></span>; <span class=\"float-notes\">high step<span>How high can you step with your body about a foot from the wall?

Aim for 5-rep strength around 80% of single rep strength, and single rep strength 75-100% of finger strength. </p>\n\n<p>**Core**: \n(on the floor) forearm plank; (hanging from a bar) knees tucked, or legs straight (L-sit); then front lever progression: knees tucked, one leg extended, legs wide, both legs extended.

That means our models are merely descriptive and cannot make \"causal\" conclusions. Still, we can expect that, if not on an individual level, then at least in aggregate, the (mean) V6 climber progresses into a V9 climber, and might progress into a V12 climber, so that the model is at least a progressive description. </p>\n\n<p>A model is only as good as the dataset it learns from: while ours clearly found stronger climbers climbed harder grades, it found that all forms of endurance, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XONhxQ-Gbk\" title=\"Super easy leg training to climb better in the cave AND on slab - Hooper's Beta Ep. 8\">leg</a>, core, and mobility training  <em>lowered</em> expected grade. These are the biases and habits of these climbers, at best a snapshot of training advice from a decade ago; certainly not how the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3XxWczzWgm1bLmgdeQJMw\" title=\"Tomoa / Akiyo / Ikedai on YouTube\">elite</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC84S_JcTHwx_NBu84qWH0Xg\" title=\"Ross & Tim on YouTube\">climbers</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4_7FcmF_Kahg05ppmzL7g\" title=\"Sofya Yokoyama on YouTube\">train</a> today.</p>\n\n\n<p>Other datasets exist, most notably the scrapped submissions from 8a.nu <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook\">downloadable</a> from Kaggle.

Certainly biased toward climbing foremost, supplemented with hangboard and system board training, he explains from grip outward how to train strength, power, core and footwork. Although he emphasizes the importance of mobility, he doesn't cover this well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.humankinetics.com/products/science-and-practice-of-strength-training-3rd-edition\">The Science and Practice of Strength Training</a> is a wonderful, (nearly fully) self-contained book on strength training intended for coaches and trainers to learn how personalize training for individuals. Discusses strength vs power in detail; strength scaling with weight; strength through muscle systems about a joint (or multiple joints).

For anyone interested in self-coaching for, possibly, multiple disciplines (aka, trail running and bouldering), this book explains the physiology of endurance vs strength training and the phases of each training cycle.
