This summer, I got stronger with some "<span class="float-notes">base<span>Base training is meant to increase training volume slowly, improve general fitness, and lay a good foundation for sport-specific training.

I should mention that I've been this strong and fit before but never climbing at the grade! So climbing practice over the many years has meant I mostly just need to be stronger (this time).</span></span> my 3-[hex](https://hiveclimbing.com/start-here/#explained) (V2-V4) plateau. Instead of continuing with <span class="float-notes">climbing<span>Usually split to first build strength and then to build power.</span></span> specific training, I spent a few months adjusting to that new strength; aka, reaping the benefits. After a decade of being warned against <span class="float-notes">hangboarding<span>On the common fear of hangboarding, in Beastmaking, Ned Feehally writes, "[fingerboard training] is the safest way of training finger strength as it is very controlled, you can apply the load slowly and let go at any time".</span></span> and (worse) <span class="float-notes">campus boarding<span>On the ubiquity of campus boarding, Ned writes, "modern climbing walls have developed so far and become so good that the campus board seems massively dated;" instead, he suggests campusing routes and training on a system board.</span></span>&mdash;"you'll injure yourself!"&mdash;why not just continue with the same training? It works! 

The first two hints against this plan come from the [9c "ultimate" climbing test](https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/how-close-are-you-to-climbing-5-15d/) and the [Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0](https://strengthclimbing.com/finger-strength-analyzer/):

  * my "9c score" is <span class="float-notes">14<span>Which corresponds to a sport climbing grade of 7b ~ 5.12b but I don't sport climb...MEC translates that to ~V5.</span></span>, 6 coming from core alone

Looks like my core and pulling training have already outpaced my finger training.

### Reading plots

If you see a bar chart, I'm counting climbers per value (eg. per V grade, per number of years, or per number of hours), or showing some amount per category.

If you see a scatter plot, each circle is one climber from the dataset with coordinates of eg. height versus V grade. The superposed line shows the average (height) over climbers (at each V grade) or the trend line when the data is too noisy. 

Pink is for female climbers; blue for male; purple is for both pooled when the data is sparse.

Most of the plots are across tabs: select each tab to view them all.

Also: <span class="float-notes">hover over me<span>Many technical comments, asides, and personal anecdotes can be found associated with the double-dash underlined text. Skip them for a 12min read; read all to add another 7min; and since pictures are ~1000 words, with all the plots you get nearly another 2 hours!</span></span>
:::

Consider a parallel <span class="float-notes">story<span>Drawn from The Science and Practice of Strength Training</span></span> of a shot putter training to throw a 7kg shot. He trains to bench press more and more, 50kg then 150kg&mdash;it's improving his throws!&mdash;200kg, 300kg&mdash;and yet he can throw no further. He got stronger, yes, but what he needed was more power. 

But what is the ideal strength profile of a boulderer? How much finger strength? How much pulling strength? How much power? More is surely better but what is a good balance progressing from V-lo through V-mid to V-hi? What about push-ups, legs and endurance?  Surely it depends on my specific goals and likely on my height, arm span, and hand size also, but general estimates would still help guide my training. 




In this post, I'll analyse and model a [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1J6d45EqIlIsIqNdi2X-Zl-EGFxf9d9T3R_W55xrpEAs/edit) collected from a survey on Reddit, including many <span class="float-notes">strength<span>Half-crimp and open hand 10s max hangs on 18mm edge; 5-rep pull-up max weight; max hanging L-sit time; # pull-ups / push-ups.</span></span> metrics, <span class="float-notes">training<span>Training specifics included hangboard protocols (eg. repeaters, max hangs, min edges, one-armed protocols, etc.), grip types trained (eg. half crimp, open hand, etc.); endurance training protocols (4x4, threshold intervals, feet on campusing, etc.); non-specific training (upper body pulling and pushing, core, legs and antagonists); other activities (running, yoga, skiing, martial arts, etc); and the number of sessions and hours per week doing various kinds of training.</span></span> habits and basic climber <span class="float-notes">attributes<span>Height, weight, arm span, years climbing, indoors vs outdoors, and various bouldering and climbing grades.</span></span>. We'll see how these climbers balance and progress their strengths through the grades; how they train at each stage; and see that height and BMI both have a <span class="float-notes">sweet spot<span>Most aspects in a complex system have a 'sweet spot': any time there are competing factors at play, the optimum is somewhere in the middle when neither penalty is too extreme. Weight scales very loosely as a cube of height; muscles is quadratic in height. If this were the only factor at play, then, in bodyweight sports, shorter would be strictly better (think gymnastics): this would give a max strength scaling with weight with power 0.666, analysing world record athletes finds a power of 0.63 -- close! In climbing, reach is still important and increases with height linearly. Balancing the two opposing factors, we should find an optimal height and corresponding weight. BMI is weight over height *squared* so it too should increase for similarly strong athletes (in a bodyweight sport) with increasing height and it too will have an optimum by the same arguments.</span></span>, not too low, not too high. 

*What about <span class="float-notes">mobility<span>Mobility is the stability and strength through your full range of motion.</span></span>? Although certainly quantifiable, no mobility assessments are in the dataset I'll be using, so my analysis will not consider it, but more on this later.*

The survey included another 513 men and 77 women. V6 is the most common grade for these climbers who are typically in their first 4 years of climbing. Climbing grades rise with the number of years and plateau after around 5 years. Higher V grade climbers are more likely to <span class="float-notes">climb outside<span>Nearly everyone in this dataset climbs inside but about half of the 'strong' climbers also climb outside. I started with trad climbing and came indoors during thesis time. For those that started inside, I strongly suggest trying bouldering on real rock. It’ll challenge your route reading infinitely more, the footwork is almost always harder and the variety of grips you’ll practice is endless.</span></span>. The women's V grades cluster at V3, V5 and V9, familiar as common plateaus; generally, in the much larger and wider dataset at Lattice Training, these fall at <a href="https://latticetraining.com/2017/08/30/milestone-grades/">V6 and V8</a>.  

Higher V grade male climbers tend to be shorter while higher V grade female climbers tend to be taller; they asymptotically meet in the middle:

> The ideal height is ~<span class="float-notes">170cm<span>Alex Megos, 173cm; Nalle Hukkataival, 173cm; Daniel Woods, 170cm; Stefano Ghisolfi, 170cm; Colin Duffy, 168cm. Akiyo Noguchi, 168cm; Janja Garnbret, 164cm; Shauna Coxsey, 163cm; Oriane Bertone, 164cm. But: Jimmy Webb, 183cm; Adam Ondra, 185cm; Jan Hojer, 188cm; Dean Potter, 196cm; and: Sean Bailey, 163cm; Brooke Raboutou, 158cm; Natalia Grossman, 157cm; Lynn Hill, 157cm; Ashima Shiraishi, 155cm; Laura Rogora, 152cm.</span></span> and +5-10 ape index.&mdash;<a href="https://youtu.be/8-5yuVuDFzU?t=2620">Adam Ondra</a>

Others that are primarily boulderers that commonly make 'top 10' lists: Guiliano Cameroni, 19.6; Jimmy Webb, 23.3; Dai Koyomada, 21.3; Adam Ondra, 20.7.</span></span>.

The women are on average lighter (58kg vs 72kg), shorter (165cm vs  179cm), have >1cm shorter ape index, have been climbing 4 months less, climb 15min less per week, train 20min less per week, and are weaker in all measures except they can hold an L-sit 10s longer; they climb 1-2 V grades lower but their hardest grade is closer to the grade they can climb 90-100% of the time. 

The highest V grade climbers climb roughly twice as much per week as beginners. Beginners don’t train at all, while the highest V grade climbers train 5-8 hours per week on average.

## Not All Surveyed V Grades are the Same

Climbers submitted three different grades: max ever, recent max (in the last 3 months ), and the grade that's "doable" 90-100% of the time. Grading gets more complicated when we consider <a href="https://boulderingboss.com/indoor-vs-outdoor-bouldering-is-there-a-difference-in-v-grades/">indoor vs outdoor</a> (or moonboard vs kilter board for that matter).  

Max ever V grade is problematic: the climber may have sent it years ago and their current strength and habits aren't what they once were. The spread is as wide as 4 V grades for a climber of 15 years and, generally, <span class="float-notes">wider<span>Although a few climbers claimed the opposite: that their recent max is higher than their max ever. Presumably, they read the survey questions wrong and I reversed their grades.</span></span> at higher V grades. 

The doable grade is highly subjective.  Should we consider all styles? Or just the style we love and climb well. What about the reachy climbs if you’re short, or the overly compressed climbs if you’re tall? Just how peaky is your <a href="https://hiveclimbing.com/blog/climbing-pyramid/">climbing pyramid</a>? Do you always get beta from others before trying? The spread from doable grade to max ever is as wide as 5 V grades; on average, the spread is wider at the higher grades. Doable grade against max recent shows the same <span class="float-notes">widening<span>A few climbers claim higher doable grade than max recent, surely impossible. I filtered out the climbers that answered 'I don't boulder' for either question. If they're bouldering at all, they could have climbed at least one problem at their doable grade.</span></span> spread.

## Max vs Max Recent
![When we compare max ever V grade to hardest in the last 3 months, the spread is as high as 4 V grades. The spread widens with more years climbing (tiny inset).](max_recent.png){width=80%}

## Doable vs Max

All plots and analysis hereafter will consider only max recent V grade.

## How Strong are the Climbers?

Finger strength is the most correlated feature we have to climbing grade. The numbers are similar for men and women and <span class="float-notes">agree<span>Though Lattice Training uses 7s/20mm max hangs vs 10s/18mm max hangs gathered by this survey.</span></span> fairly well with the climbers from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zNGplJMyG/" target="__blank">Lattice Training</a>: each V grade requires adding another 8% of body weight to max hangs; to climb 9c would require ~<span class="float-notes">1.1<span>That's a hang with 110% of bodyweight added, or 210% total weight.</span></span>. Silence, the first 9c, was put up by Adam Ondra with max hangs of 112%; Bibliographie, briefly the second 9c, was first climbed by Alex Megos whose max hangs are an astonishing 132%. 

While finger strength didn’t show a big gender difference, the normalized weight added to 5 pull-ups is <span class="float-notes">10-20% more<span>Either the women make do with less pulling strength or they prefer problems that don’t require it.</span></span> for male climbers at any given grade. Pulling strength increases with grade up to around <span class="float-notes">0.8<span>80% of bodyweight, in agreement with the pulling to finger strength ratio recommended by the Climbing Finger Strength Analyzer 2.0 (0.75) and the Lattice Training finger strength estimate of 1.1 to climb 9c, where 0.8 ~ 0.75*1.1.</span></span> at the highest grades. 
For any given grade, the male climbers seem to do twice as many pull-ups or push-ups as the women. Despite many over-achievers, more modest goals of 20-25 pull-ups and 30-40 push-ups seem sufficient for climbing. 
Less than 25% submitted their L-sit time and many <span class="float-notes">suspiciously<span>Were they just guessing or did they get bored and give up?</span></span> answered an even 30s and 60s and 12 with times exceeding the world record.

Here are the same metrics visually; like before, click through the tabs to see them all.

## 5-rep Weighted Pullups
![For 5-rep pull-up strength, the women trend a steady 0.2 (or 20% of bodyweight) below the men. Ideally, this strength should be less than finger strength and we'll see later that, in higher V grade climbers, it is.](5reppullups.png){width=80%}

What about differences in strength metrics: how does finger strength compare with pulling strength? And how do they compare as we get stronger? How do half crimp and open hand compare for finger strength?

When finger and pulling strength are still low, pulling strength exceeds finger strength in both women and men. As they increase, women quickly develop <span class="float-notes">far more<span>Megan has more than 6x finger strength than pulling strength!</span></span> stronger fingers; the men develop equal finger strength only when both are ~50% body weight. In the strongest climbers, finger strength settles at roughly double pulling strength.

The difference between <span class="float-notes">half crimp<span>Not to be confused with full crimp that engages the thumb.</span></span> and  <span class="float-notes">open hand<span>Not to be confused with 3 finger drag that drops the pinky.</span></span> max hangs may average out to zero but less than a third of <span class="float-notes">those<span>35% of climbers gave half crimp max hangs, 28% gave open hand max hangs while 25% gave both: which tips the balance another 10% in favour of half crimps.

In Beastmaking, Ned suggests that hand anatomy plays a role in which grip a climber favours. Full- and half-crimp are generally the stronger grip but open hand places less strain on the finger pulleys.

## Open vs Half Crimp

## Bouldering Predictions

With this dataset of nearly <span class="float-notes">600<span>Dropping a few with suspicious data including those claiming to have broken world records.</span></span> climbers, I could train a <span class="float-notes">model<span>Several in fact, of various kinds: I started with linear regression, went to 2-4 layer dense neural networks before settling on random forests then boosted trees (which, of course, are usually best for tabular data like this). I trained many of each kind, keeping various subsets of climber features, and settled on a model that gave consistent feature influences.</span></span> to predict the hardest recent V grade of each climber given their strength metrics and training habits. The model has only mild <span class="float-notes">regression to the mean<span>Low V grade climbers are predicted high, while high V grade climbers are predicted low.</span></span>, surprising since there were many metrics that weren't provided; typical errors were <2 V grades. 

::: {.column-margin}
A simple way to assess feature importance is with correlation with grade (numbers are using only climbers that provide that feature). The model can better utilize a feature if more climbers provide it (percentage that did in brackets): 

<ul>
  <li>open hand strength, 0.64 (28%)</li>
  <li>half crimp strength, 0.59 (35%)</li>
  <li># pull-ups, 0.49 (78%)</li>
  <li>year, 0.43 (all)</li>
  <li>hrs climbing per week, 0.32 (all)</li>
  <li># hangboard/campus board sessions per week, 0.34/0.3 (all, 56%/26% do)</li>
  <li>L-sit time, 0.31 (31%)</li>
  <li>5-rep pull-up strength, 0.29 (46%)</li>
  <li>hrs training per week, 0.26 (all, 46% train endurance, 79% train strength)</li>
  <li># push-ups, 0.13 (61%)</li>
  <li>BMI, -0.13 (all) </li>
</ul>
:::

The <span class="float-notes">feature *importance*<span>Calculated by shuffling the values of that feature among all climbers and seeing how much worse the predictions are on average. The range each feature can take varies widely, and shuffling can give an entirely unreasonable shift in a given climber. Years vary from 0 to 15 and BMI from 15 to 30, and yet most of us can't wait a year to improve and fret over BMI increments of a few pounds. Compare that to hrs on the campus board per week that varies from 0 to 5 where half an hour can make a difference.</span></span> estimates how much the model relies on it for predictions; feature *influence* is the average gains for a standard small shift in that feature. 

By far the most important feature is how many years a climber has been climbing and, next in importance, is the number of hours climbing per week. After all: 

>   Climbing is the best training for climbing

The top strength metrics by any measure are the number of pull-ups, half crimp strength, and the number of hours campus board training per week. Campus board training is synonymous with training for <span class="float-notes">power<span>Power is a measure of the rate of force applied; think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe4LyDihDQ" title="What is Contact Strength? (A Climbing Nerd’s Investigation) Part 1/3 from Hooper's Beta">contact strength</a> and how much harder it is to catch a bad hold in a lunge than to grab it statically, or think of the fast pulling strength to initiate that lunge.</span></span> so we can say:

>   Finger and pulling strength and power are the best predictors of climbing grade

Consistently important and somewhat influential, we find BMI. For climbers with BMI < 20 (>25), raising (lowering) BMI always increases the expected grade; in between, predictions go up or down depending on the individual. The largest prediction changes were for climbers that didn't provide many strength metrics; for the three of us that did, BMI influence was <span class="float-notes">tiny<span>I saw the largest gains: by lowering my BMI by 0.5 (aka, losing 3lbs), my predicted grade increases by 0.17.</span></span>. 

Both feature assessments entirely ignore the <span class="float-notes">correlation<span>And among all the other features too. Features that are strongly correlated: number of pull-ups and pull-up strength (0.50), number of pull-ups and number of push-ups (0.44), years climbing and half crimp strength (0.34), BMI and number of push-ups (0.24), etc.</span></span> of BMI to the strength metrics: being <span class="float-notes">lighter<span>Furthermore, the denominator in the normalized metrics further amplifies any weight loss.</span></span> makes all body-weight exercises easier; while having more muscle more than compensates for the added weight. There's a limit in both lines of thinking: we should only lose excess fat and muscle and keep a safe weight for optimal recovery; we should only gain muscle beneficial to climbing and carefully balance muscle strength. To quote Tomoa from <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/climbing/beastmaking/">Beastmaking</a>:

>   After trying to reinforce a specific skill or train a body part, it is found that it made the total balance of the body corrupted.  &mdash;Tomoa Narasaki

To estimate the maximum expected gains of each climber, we can add up all the positive influences. These gains diminish with grade; but, luckily (if true), Megan, Nelson and I have high estimated gains for our V grade.

## Feature Influence

## Feature Importance

![The <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/feature-importance.html">permutation importance</a> of each feature gives the (normalized) increase in <a class="float-notes" title="Averaged over all climbers, the 30 held out climbers included.">mean</a> squared error when that feature is randomly shuffled. Given that the error nearly doubles, 'years' is a very important feature.](feat_imp.png){width=80%}

## Max Gains

![With the step shifts used to assess feature influence, adding up the positive steps each climber can take defines their maximal gains. The gains per climber go down with grade.](max_gains.png){width=80%}

## Predictions

![This <a href="https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">lightgbm</a> model was trained holding out a random 30 climbers (in green) including Megan, Nelson and me: that the test climbers are predicted as well as the others is a sign the model trained well.](pred.png){width=80%}

The influence of each feature depends on the profile of a given climber. Here are the gains by feature for Megan, Nelson and I as examples. Of course, we won't suddenly climb harder by <span class="float-notes">changing<span>The influence of changing training and getting stronger is not something this dataset can answer since it only has a single snapshot of each climber in their present state.</span></span> training habits; rather, these are the nearest profiles to us that the model expects to have the biggest jump in grade and we might expect good results if we emulate them (and we trust the model and the dataset).

## Megan
![The expected feature influence for Megan's <a class="float-notes" title="Her open hand strength is roughly twice her half crimp strength and 6.5x her pulling strength; her L-sit time is 38s; lately, she isn't training and climbing very little.">profile</a>: more pull-ups; power training; and increase both grips with emphasis on her dominant open hand grip.](d_megan.png){width=80%}

## Nelson
![The expected feature influence for Nelson's <a class="float-notes" title="His open hand strength > half crimp strength > pulling strength but with better balance than either Megan or I; his L-sit time is 27s; lately, he doesn't train but climbs 10hrs per week.">profile</a>: biggest gains to strengthen his half crimp; start power training; and increase his L-sit time. The predicted gains from losing 1.5kg don't seem worth it.](d_nelson.png){width=80%}

## Lara
![The expected feature influence for my <a class="float-notes" title="My half crimp strength > pulling strength >> open hand strength; my L-sit time is 30s; lately, I do some training and climb 6-8hrs per week.">profile</a>: power training, more pull-ups, increase half crimp strength, climb more, increase 5-rep pull-up strength, lose 3lbs, and more push-ups.](d_lara.png){width=80%}

## Your Data Next

We've studied these climbers and, although we haven't discovered an ideal training progression, rough strength scales emerged that agree with intuition and the training literature. Are you more like Megan with >6x stronger fingers than pulling strength? Or like the handful of climbers that can add nearly their full bodyweight to 5 pullups and yet only climb V4? Assess yourself to see your strength profile: how balanced is it and how does it compare to the grades you're climbing? As you progress, how does your climbing improve with increased strength?

Test as many aspects as you like, but do not <span class="float-notes">train<span>They fail to serve if you start to train to them specifically (max hangs being an exception), aka you overfit if you train to the test. For instance, 'core' is more than the muscles of your torso; it's the entire chain of muscles that lets you hold tension from hands to feet. Assessing with hanging L-sits doesn't cover the entire chain; the front lever comes closer, but neither covers the full variety of positions you'll hopefully get into bouldering.</span></span> to them. Assess once per training cycle to influence how you train in the next one; twice a year to monitor your progress if you're training by climbing. 

>  If you are still getting stronger and better by just climbing, then just climb! 

From one assessment to the next, look for trends in your response to different training stimuli. When you start to plateau with a given exercise, try a more advanced progression, if any, or just switch things up (eg. max hangs to repeaters).

<p>**Max hangs** in half crimp, open hand, on a sloper, pinching, etc.:
7-10s on a 20mm edge. One arm or two depends on how much weight you need to add; at some point, it makes more sense to take a little weight off and assess one-armed, with the added benefit of checking for left/right asymmetries. </p>

<p>**Pull-ups**: 
Unweighted pull-ups are to endurance as weighted single reps are to strength, as 5-rep weighted pull-ups are to strength endurance. Aim for 5-rep strength around 80% of single rep strength, and single rep strength 75-100% of finger strength. </p>

<p>**Core**: 
(on the floor) forearm plank; (hanging from a bar) knees tucked, or legs straight (L-sit); then front lever progression: knees tucked, one leg extended, legs wide, both legs extended. Pick the hardest 1-2 you can do 5-30s.</p>

<p>**Power**:
explosive pull-ups / muscle-ups for pulling power; assess your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFe4LyDihDQ" title="What is Contact Strength? (A Climbing Nerd’s Investigation) Part 1/3 from Hooper's Beta">contact strength</a> with system board climbs that challenge it, or on a <a href="https://mojagear.com/campus-board-training-with-eric-horst/">campus board</a>. Maybe your gym has hangboard with a time-resolved force meter.</p>

<p>**Push-ups / Dips**:
Useful for mantelling but stop at 20-40. Don't neglect the other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEaqJ4Cc1Fo" title="Killer Home Shoulder Circuit for Rock Climbers (LONG) // from Gumby to Sharma from Hooper's Beta">antagonists</a>.</p>

## ML Conclusions

<p>We have a single snapshot of each climber, not their individual progression, certainly not the interventions (aka, the training) they undertook to progress in their climbing. That means our models are merely descriptive and cannot make "causal" conclusions. Still, we can expect that, if not on an individual level, then at least in aggregate, the (mean) V6 climber progresses into a V9 climber, and might progress into a V12 climber, so that the model is at least a progressive description. </p>

<p>A model is only as good as the dataset it learns from: while ours clearly found stronger climbers climbed harder grades, it found that all forms of endurance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XONhxQ-Gbk" title="Super easy leg training to climb better in the cave AND on slab - Hooper's Beta Ep. 8">leg</a>, core, and mobility training  <em>lowered</em> expected grade. These are the biases and habits of these climbers, at best a snapshot of training advice from a decade ago; certainly not how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3XxWczzWgm1bLmgdeQJMw" title="Tomoa / Akiyo / Ikedai on YouTube">elite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC84S_JcTHwx_NBu84qWH0Xg" title="Ross & Tim on YouTube">climbers</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4_7FcmF_Kahg05ppmzL7g" title="Sofya Yokoyama on YouTube">train</a> today.</p>


<p>Other datasets exist, most notably the scrapped submissions from 8a.nu <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook">downloadable</a> from Kaggle.  I have plans to test a graph neural network to look for climbing cliques, correlated climb progressions, etc. </p>
